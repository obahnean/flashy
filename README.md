FLASHY is a Graphic User Interface program written in python that helps the user to learn French words. I went on Wikipedia
and looked for the most common 100 words and put them into a file frenchwords.csv, both the English and the French version.

Once the program is runned first, a new file with the words that need to be studied will be generated as words_to_learn.csv.
At first, a French word will pop out and after 3 seconds the card will flip and it will show the English version.

Now, the user has a choice to make. Either presses the X button which means that he has to keep studying that word or press the check
mark button and that word will be removed from that list. Only words that the user does not know will be displayed further.

Once the user exits the program, his progress will be saved into the words_to_learn file. 

Please check the provided images for a better sense of the program.

Or do not trust me and run it yourself.
